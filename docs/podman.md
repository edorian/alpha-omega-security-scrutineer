# Podman & rootless runtime — security model

Scrutineer runs each scan's untrusted workload — the cloned repository plus
`claude -p --permission-mode bypassPermissions` and the analysis tools — inside
an ephemeral container. The runtime is selectable with `--runtime docker|podman`
(default `docker`; see [Podman (rootless)](../README.md#podman-rootless) in the
README for setup).

This is a companion to [threatmodel.md](../threatmodel.md): it covers what the
**podman / rootless** runtime changes about the security posture, and — the main
point — the gaps it does **not** close. It assumes the threat model's framing,
in particular T1 (RCE via a hostile repository), T12 (runtime access), and T13
(runner egress).

## Where the runtime sits

scrutineer runs as a host process and execs the runtime directly; it does **not**
mount a runtime socket (threatmodel T12, "run scrutineer as a host process").
The runtime's only job is to confine boundary 3 of the threat model — the
untrusted checkout and the model/tools that parse it. Choosing docker vs podman
changes *how strongly* that boundary holds, not what runs inside it.

Three configurations exist, weakest to strongest:

- `--no-docker` — no container; the workload runs on the host as the operator.
  Least isolation (unchanged, out of scope for this document).
- `--runtime docker` *(default)* or rootful podman — container-root maps to a
  uid the daemon runs as; the daemon/socket is root-equivalent.
- `--runtime podman` **rootless** — daemonless, and container-root maps to an
  unprivileged host sub-uid.

## Properties rootless podman adds

- **Runtime access is not root-equivalent.** Rootless podman is daemonless;
  there is no root-owned `docker.sock`. A compromise of the scrutineer process
  cannot trivially become host-root through the runtime — the residual concern
  in T12.
- **Container-root is an unprivileged sub-uid.** In the rootless user namespace,
  uid 0 inside the container maps to a subordinate uid on the host. An escape
  from the scan container (the T1 endgame) lands unprivileged, not near-root.
  This is the largest blast-radius reduction.
- **The workspace stays operator-owned via `--userns=keep-id`.** The container
  process is mapped back to the invoking user's uid, so the `/work` output and
  the `/claude-config` resume store are owned by the operator — not root, not an
  opaque sub-uid. Without keep-id, rootless bind-mount writes land under a
  remapped sub-uid and break the scan; the runner injects it only for rootless
  podman (docker and rootful podman already run as the host uid).

## Network isolation and hardened mode

Default (cooperative) mode is unchanged from the docker path (T13): the container
reaches the network through an allowlisting host proxy via `HTTPS_PROXY` /
`HTTP_PROXY`, but a workload that ignores those variables is not blocked at the
network layer.

`--hardened` is the enforced mode: each scan gets a dedicated `--internal`
network so a workload ignoring the proxy has no route out, and concurrent scans
cannot reach each other. On docker's bridge driver this property is well
understood and trusted. **On rootless podman it is verified, not assumed**,
because rootless `--internal` semantics vary across network backends (pasta,
slirp4netns, netavark) and versions. Before each rootless-podman hardened scan
two throwaway containers run on the actual per-scan network:

1. **Egress is blocked** — with no proxy environment, an attempt to reach a
   *literal* routable IP must fail. A literal address (not a hostname) is used
   deliberately: DNS is also cut on `--internal`, so a hostname target would
   fail for the wrong reason and read as a false pass.
2. **The host proxy is reachable** — a connection to the proxy through the
   host-gateway alias, wired exactly as the real run wires it, must succeed.

The check is **fail-closed**: if either property cannot be confirmed — including
a probe that cannot even execute (e.g. no `curl` in a custom runner image) — the
scan is **refused** rather than run under a weaker sandbox. It is gated to
**rootless** podman only: docker and rootful podman both run a bridge in the host
netns (gateway on the host, docker's model), so they keep the trusted path and
pay no probe cost. Rootless podman is the case where `--internal` can sever the
host path across the pasta/slirp4netns boundary, which is why it alone is proven.

## `--hardened` under rootless podman

`--hardened` is frequently **not usable under rootless podman**, and scrutineer
will refuse such scans rather than run them degraded. This is structural, not a
misconfiguration:

- Hardened mode puts each scan on its own `--internal` network and routes the
  scan's only egress through scrutineer's proxy **on the host**, reached via the
  container's gateway.
- `--internal` deliberately severs the route out of the container's network
  namespace. Under **docker (or rootful podman)** the bridge gateway *is* the
  host, so the host proxy is still reachable. Under **rootless podman** the host
  proxy lives *across* the rootless network-namespace boundary (pasta /
  slirp4netns), and `--internal` cuts exactly that path — so the scan container
  cannot reach the proxy at all.

The per-scan verification (probe 2 above) catches this and **fails closed**:

    hardened network verification: internal network "scrutineer-hardened-N"
    cannot reach the host egress proxy at <gateway>:<port> ("UNREACHABLE");
    the only egress path is broken

That is the safe outcome — scrutineer refuses rather than silently running a
weaker sandbox — but it means hardened scans do not start on these hosts. (Note
this is independent of any host firewall: it reproduces with a fully open
`iptables`/`nftables`, because the break is the namespace boundary, not a packet
filter. It is also independent of SELinux.)

### Three ways to deal with it

Weakest change to strongest isolation:

1. **Default mode under rootless** *(recommended baseline; no change)* — drop
   `--hardened`. Add **`--hardened-rootless-runtime`** to still get a read-only
   rootfs and `no-new-privileges` (they don't need the `--internal` network — see
   the next subsection). You keep the non-root-equivalent runtime and, on an
   enforcing host, SELinux `:z` confinement; you give up only enforced egress.
2. **Rootful podman or docker for `--hardened`** — with a daemon runtime the
   `--internal` gateway *is* the host, so hardened works as designed. The cost is
   the T12 property: runtime access becomes root-equivalent again, which is the
   main reason to prefer rootless. Reasonable only on a dedicated/throwaway host.
3. **Egress-gateway sidecar** *(not yet implemented; the proper fix)* — run the
   allowlisting proxy as a container attached to **both** the per-scan
   `--internal` network and a normal egress network. The scan container stays
   internal-only and reaches *only* the sidecar; the sidecar enforces the
   allowlist and forwards out its egress interface (and reaches the host skill
   API the way default mode does today). This makes enforced egress work under
   rootless without the scan container ever needing to reach the host. Tracked as
   future work.

### `--hardened-rootless-runtime`: the non-network half of hardened

Three of hardened mode's controls have **no network dependency** — a read-only
rootfs, `no-new-privileges`, and the post-clone workspace cap — so they don't
need `--internal` and work fine under rootless podman's default network.
`--hardened-rootless-runtime` (config `hardened_rootless_runtime: true`) applies
exactly those, independently of `--hardened`:

- `--read-only` on the container rootfs. Writable paths remain `/work`, the
  `/tmp` tmpfs (with `HOME=/tmp`), and the `/claude-config` bind mount on
  resumable runs.
- `--security-opt no-new-privileges`.
- The 2 GiB post-clone workspace cap — a host-side size check that refuses
  pathologically large clones (threatmodel T9). It's pure host-side `du`, so it
  has nothing to do with the runtime, network, or rootless-ness; it belongs here
  precisely because it isn't network-coupled.

It is the recommended add-on for rootless deployments that can't use full
`--hardened`. It is not strictly rootless-specific — it works under docker and
rootful podman too — but `--hardened` already implies all of it there, so the
flag is redundant with (and harmless alongside) `--hardened`. It has no effect
under `--no-docker` (there is no container; startup warns if you combine them),
and startup logs `hardened_rootless_runtime=<bool>` so you can confirm it is
active.

**Caveat — custom profile images.** A read-only rootfs breaks any runner image
that writes outside `/work` and `/tmp` at scan time. The default runner image is
built to run read-only; a per-ecosystem profile image may not be (e.g. a
toolchain that caches under a path other than `$HOME`, which is `/tmp` here).
This is the same constraint `--hardened` carries, and the reason container
hardening is opt-in rather than always-on.

### What each mode applies

| control | default | `--hardened-rootless-runtime` | `--hardened` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `--cap-drop ALL` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| non-root `--user <uid>:<gid>` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `/tmp` tmpfs (`noexec,nosuid`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| SELinux `:z` (enforcing host), keep-id (rootless), default seccomp/AppArmor | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| read-only rootfs + `no-new-privileges` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 2 GiB post-clone workspace cap (T9 DoS guard) | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| per-scan `--internal` network — enforced egress + inter-scan isolation | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

The top four rows are the unconditional baseline; `--hardened-rootless-runtime`
adds the next two; full `--hardened` adds the last row on top.

### What running rootless *without* full `--hardened` gives up

With `--hardened-rootless-runtime` the **only** remaining gap is the bottom row of
the table — the per-scan `--internal` network, i.e. *network enforcement*. That's
two things, both network, and both structurally impossible under rootless without
the sidecar:

- **Enforced egress** — the proxy stays *cooperative*: a workload that ignores
  `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` can dial the internet directly (threatmodel T13).
  The `--internal` network is the only thing that turns it into a hard wall, and
  it's the part that can't reach the host proxy across the rootless netns
  boundary. Without it, only the pinned-and-audited runner image (T11) bounds a
  proxy-ignoring workload.
- **Per-scan network isolation** — concurrent scans share the runtime's default
  network instead of each getting its own `--internal` network.

Restoring these under rootless needs the egress-gateway sidecar (option 3); until
then, rootless + `--hardened-rootless-runtime` + SELinux is a strong posture, and
rootful podman/docker is the route to full enforced egress.

## SELinux and bind-mount file passing

On hosts with SELinux enabled — the default on Fedora, RHEL, CentOS Stream,
Rocky and Alma, which is where rootless podman most often runs — the scan
container runs as the confined type `container_t`, while the host paths
scrutineer bind-mounts in keep their own labels: `/work` (the clone, staged
skill, injected `CLAUDE.md` and output), `/claude-config` (the resumable session
store), and `/src` (profile detection). The base `container-selinux` policy
denies `container_t` access to those labels, so without intervention the
container cannot read the clone or write its output and **every scan fails with
`EACCES`** — even though uid/gid ownership (handled by `--userns=keep-id`) is
correct. SELinux/MAC and DAC are separate layers; rootless podman on an enforcing
host needs both addressed. This bites podman hardest, but the same applies to
docker on an enforcing host, and the fix below covers both engines.

scrutineer fixes this by appending the `:z` relabel option to its bind mounts.
Detection is **engine-agnostic**: it checks the host for `/sys/fs/selinux` (the
selinuxfs mountpoint) rather than parsing `podman info` / `docker info`, so it
behaves identically for both engines (scrutineer execs the runtime locally and
relabels local paths, so the host's own state is authoritative). The behaviour is
gated by the `--selinux` switch (config key `selinux:`):

| value | behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `auto` *(default)* | Relabel only when SELinux is detected on the host. Non-SELinux hosts are wholly unaffected — no relabel option, no smoke test, byte-for-byte the previous behaviour. |
| `on` | Always relabel. Escape hatch for a host where scrutineer can't see selinuxfs but the engine still labels containers. Harmless on a non-SELinux host (the engine ignores the relabel request). |
| `off` | Never relabel. Escape hatch for operators who pre-label the data dir themselves (`semanage fcontext` + `restorecon`, or `chcon -t container_file_t`) or run the engine with `--security-opt label=disable`. |

When relabeling is active, a **startup smoke test** mounts a throwaway temp dir
exactly the way a scan does (same `--user`, plus `--userns=keep-id` under
rootless podman) and confirms the container can read a host-written file and
write one the host can read back. A failure aborts startup with an actionable
message rather than letting every scan fail silently. The check no-ops when
relabeling is off or the runner image isn't present locally yet (the first scan
pulls it and would surface the same issue then).

### Why `:z` (shared) and not `:Z` (private)

podman supports two relabel options. `:z` relabels the content to the shared type
`container_file_t` with no MCS category; `:Z` adds a private per-container MCS
category so only the labeling container can access it. scrutineer uses `:z`:

- **Host read-back.** After a scan, the scrutineer *host* process reads the
  output report back out of `/work`. `:z` keeps it host-readable; `:Z`'s private
  category could be denied to a host process running in a confined SELinux domain
  — locking scrutineer out of the very report it asked for.
- **Overlapping mounts.** `/work` and `/src` point at the same clone tree; one
  shared label keeps the two relabels consistent instead of churning a private
  category between them.
- **Isolation model.** scrutineer separates scans with per-scan work roots and,
  under `--hardened`, per-scan `--internal` networks — not SELinux MCS. `:Z`'s
  extra container-to-container separation isn't load-bearing here.

The trade-off `:z` accepts is that any `container_t` process on the host could
read a scan's *ephemeral* workspace. That's outside scrutineer's threat model
(the concern is a hostile repo escaping the sandbox, not a sibling local
container reading a throwaway clone). Operators who want the stricter per-scan
MCS isolation should pre-label their data dir and run with `--selinux=off`; `:Z`
is deliberately not exposed as a switch so the host read-back guarantee stays
simple.

## Gaps and residual risks

These are **not** addressed by the podman / rootless runtime and remain open:

1. **Default-mode egress is cooperative, not enforced.** Only `--hardened`
   blocks a proxy-ignoring workload (pre-existing T13 residual; both runtimes) —
   and `--hardened` is itself often unavailable under rootless podman (see
   [`--hardened` under rootless podman](#--hardened-under-rootless-podman)), so
   rootless deployments commonly run with cooperative egress.
2. **keep-id widens the user namespace to include the operator's uid.** A
   container escape that pivots to that uid could touch host files owned by the
   operator *that are reachable through the bind mounts*. Far better than
   rootful, but not zero — run scrutineer as a dedicated low-privilege user.
3. **Host-gateway reachability is environment-dependent.** On some rootless
   network configurations (or podman < 4.7) the container may not reach the
   host egress proxy. This fails safe, not open: hardened mode *refuses* the
   scan (its proxy is the enforcement boundary), and default mode surfaces it
   as scans failing with network errors — a loud functional failure, not a
   silent security downgrade, because the default-mode proxy is cooperative
   (gap #1), not an enforcement boundary. scrutineer logs a startup warning
   when it cannot resolve the host-gateway under podman; the fix is podman
   >= 4.7 and a working rootless network backend. Not auto-remediated beyond
   the warning.
4. **podman < 4.7 is warned, not gated.** `--add-host …:host-gateway` is
   unsupported below 4.7, so egress breaks; startup logs a warning (hardened
   additionally catches it via verification) but does not block.
5. **Profile base-image freshness degrades without `skopeo`.** podman has no
   `buildx imagetools`; without skopeo a moved `:latest` runner tag won't
   trigger a per-ecosystem profile rebuild (the cache keys on the ref string),
   so a stale profile image may be reused until pruned. Not a code-execution
   risk (the base is still the pinned ref), but a freshness gap.
6. **Hardened verification needs `curl` in the runner image.** A custom
   `--runner-image` without curl makes verification fail closed (safe) but
   unusable.
7. **Verification is point-in-time.** It proves isolation at scan start, not
   continuously; it does not detect a mid-scan network reconfiguration. The
   per-scan network is ephemeral and created by scrutineer, but this is a TOCTOU
   window against a host-local privileged actor (who already out-ranks the
   sandbox).
8. **No runner resource limits under either runtime.** No `--memory`,
   `--pids-limit`, or CPU caps are set, so a hostile repo can still attempt local
   resource exhaustion (threatmodel T9, open). Under rootless podman, cgroup
   limits additionally require cgroup v2 delegation, which scrutineer neither
   requires nor configures.
9. **User-namespace / sub-id exhaustion is not pre-checked.** Many concurrent
   rootless containers consume userns and subuid ranges; if exhausted, the
   container fails to start and the scan fails.
10. **Kernel attack surface is shared.** Like docker, rootless podman shares the
    host kernel; user namespaces reduce but do not eliminate kernel-LPE surface.
    For stronger isolation, a VM-backed or syscall-filtering runtime (sysbox,
    gVisor) remains the option noted in T12 — not implemented.
11. **seccomp/AppArmor parity, not improvement.** The runtime's default profiles
    are used under both engines; no custom profile is added.
12. **Supply chain is unchanged.** podman pulls the same GHCR runner image;
    threatmodel T11 carries over verbatim.

## Operational guidance

- For untrusted inputs, the strongest posture is a non-root-equivalent runtime
  plus verified network isolation. But `--hardened` is **frequently unusable
  under rootless podman** — the scan container can't reach the host proxy on an
  `--internal` network, so the scan is refused (see [`--hardened` under rootless
  podman](#--hardened-under-rootless-podman)). Use **rootful podman or docker**
  if you need full `--hardened` today; otherwise run **rootless with
  `--hardened-rootless-runtime`** (read-only rootfs + no-new-privileges on the
  always-on `--cap-drop ALL` / non-root / SELinux baseline), accepting that
  egress is then cooperative, not enforced.
- Run scrutineer as a **dedicated low-privilege OS user** to bound gap #2.
- Ensure **podman ≥ 4.7** and a configured `/etc/subuid` / `/etc/subgid` range
  for that user (`podman system migrate` applies changes). Install **skopeo** if
  you rely on per-ecosystem profiles staying current.
- Treat the open threatmodel residuals (T9 resource caps, T13 cooperative
  default) as still applying under podman.
