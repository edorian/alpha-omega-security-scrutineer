# verify

Take an existing finding produced by a prior audit skill and check whether it still holds against the current code. A verify run answers one question: does the reproduction in the finding's validation step still trigger the dangerous behaviour?

## Workspace

- `./src` — the repository at its current HEAD
- `./context.json` — has `scrutineer.api_base`, `scrutineer.token`, `scrutineer.repository_id`, and `scrutineer.finding_id` (required; this skill only makes sense finding-scoped)
- `./report.json` — write the verify report here
- `./schema.json` — output shape

## What to do

1. Read `./context.json`. If `scrutineer.finding_id` is missing, write `{"status": "inconclusive", "notes": "no finding_id in context.json; verify is finding-scoped"}` and exit.

2. Fetch the finding: `GET {api_base}/findings/{finding_id}` with `Authorization: Bearer {token}`. You get back title, severity, location, cwe, affected, and the six-step prose (trace, boundary, validation, prior_art, reach, rating). If the fetch returns non-200, write `{"status": "inconclusive", "evidence": "", "notes": "fetch failed: <status>"}` and exit.

3. Read the `validation` field. This is the original reproduction instructions: how to run it, what it looked like when it worked, what dangerous behaviour was observed.

4. Re-run the reproduction against `./src` at HEAD. The point of this skill is to check whether the finding still holds against the current code, so always test HEAD. Be conservative:
   - Only run what the validation field describes. Do not improvise a new attack vector.
   - If the validation is prose-only (no concrete script), try to execute what it describes literally. If you cannot turn the prose into a runnable check, that is `inconclusive` — say why.
   - If the validation installs the package from a registry (`gem install foo`, `pip install foo`), build and install from `./src` instead so you are testing HEAD, not the last release. If the package cannot be built locally, status is `inconclusive` with the build error in `notes`.
   - Record the exact reproduction you ran into `reproducer`, verbatim: the full script contents, command line, or crafted input — not a description of it. If you wrote a file to disk, paste its contents; if you ran shell commands, paste them. A report whose `evidence` shows output but whose `reproducer` only says "ran the repro" is useless: the analyst cannot tell what was executed or re-run it.
   - Capture the result of running it — stdout, stderr, exit code — into `evidence`. Paste relevant excerpts.

5. Decide the status:
   - **confirmed** — the reproduction produces the same dangerous behaviour as the original. The finding is still live.
   - **fixed** — the reproduction does not reproduce, AND you can identify what stopped it (a guard, a sanitiser, a refactor that removed the sink). Cite the commit or file:line that fixed it in `notes`.
   - **inconclusive** — one of:
     - the reproduction couldn't run (missing tool, platform mismatch, network dependency)
     - the code has drifted enough that the original trace no longer maps cleanly onto the current tree
     - the reproduction ran but produced a different outcome you cannot classify

   Do not mark `fixed` just because the reproduction failed; "I ran it and nothing happened" is `inconclusive` unless you can point at why.

## Output

Write `./report.json`:

```json
{
  "status": "confirmed" | "fixed" | "inconclusive",
  "reproducer": "...",
  "evidence": "...",
  "notes": "..."
}
```

`reproducer` is the verbatim script/commands/input you ran; `evidence` is the output they produced. Both belong in the report — the output alone, without the thing that generated it, cannot be acted on.

Scrutineer updates the finding's lifecycle status based on your answer:
- `confirmed` moves a `new` finding to `enriched`
- `fixed` moves any finding to `fixed`
- `inconclusive` leaves the status alone

The reproducer, evidence, and notes are appended to the finding's Notes field with a timestamp header so the analyst can read your trail later — and re-run the reproducer.
